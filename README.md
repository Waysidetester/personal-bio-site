# Personal Portfolio Site

## Purpose
Welcome to my personal site! Feel free to look around the source code!

Currently, my site can only be viewed through cloning my repo and spooling it through http-server. 

## To View

1. Clone repository to local machine.
1. run the following command to download webpage dependencies: ```npm install```
1. open two terminals:

1. In terminal one run

* ```npm run json```

5. In terminal two run 

* ```npm start``` 

This should automatically open a new tab in your default browser.

## Notes

Some links lack functionality. As I progress my knowledge, I will continue to expand the site and sections provided. Feel free to look at some of the projects featured on the site as well!
