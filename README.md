# Personal Portfolio Site

## Purpose
Welcome to my personal site! Feel free to look around the source code!

Currently, my site can only be viewed through cloning my repo and spooling it through http-server. 

## To View

1. Clone repository to local machine.
1. Using http-server (`$ npm install http-server`) feed project to the port 8888 (`-p 8888`)
1. open localhost:8888 in your browsers address bar

## Notes

The CSS file uses FLEXBOX and Bootstrap in it's current state. If you are running this on Internet Explorer, the styling won't work properly on all objects within this project.

Some links lack functionality. As I progress my knowledge, I will continue to expand the site and sections provided. Feel free to look at some of the projects featured on the site as well!
